## Tag Management

Tags are freeform strings attached to any ticket. They enable cross-cutting organization alongside status-based columns.

## Editing Tags

Use the tag editor in the ticket detail modal to add or remove tags. Type a tag name and press Enter to add it.

## Filtering

Use the filter input in the board toolbar to search tickets by title, tag, or ID.
